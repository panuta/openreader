                        <div class="answer" data-id="1">
                            OpenReader is a cloud service designed for businesses. It will help you manage and organize all your company files in one central digital liblary. It makes meetings easier and exchanging files with colleagues a simple task!
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#" class="question" data-id="2">How can I try Openreader for free?</a>
                        <div class="answer" data-id="2">
                            The first month you can try it without any costs. We won't even ask for your payment information before you decide whether you want to keep using this platform. If you do however decide to keep it, payment will start immediately. First month included.
                        </div>
                    </li>

                        <div class="answer" data-id="3">
                            You sure can! You can add or remove as many users as you want and it won't even effect your contract length. Payment is always per month and at the end of the month.
                        </div>
                    </li>

                        <div class="answer" data-id="4">
                            The bigs difference is that the admin user, normally someone higher up in the company’s hierarchy, controls the individual document permission. Confidentiality is key in all of OpenReader, in this way you can even ensure this in your company itself.
                            <br /><br />
The Admin user is also able to add or remove users and organizations.

                            The user needs an Ipad to view and read all of his files. Controlling document permission, adding or removing people and organizations happens on the OpenReader website.

It depends on the contract you have. If you have an one year contract and you want to terminate it, the remaining fee will have to be paid. This fee is based on the amount of users the contract was signed with at the beginning of the contract and on the amount of months still remaining.
